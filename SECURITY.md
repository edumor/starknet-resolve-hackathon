### 🔍 Security Measures

Our project implements several security measures:

- **Smart Contract Security**: OpenZeppelin contracts and patterns

- **Wallet Security**: Secure connection protocols
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed before merge
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability checks

## Security Considerations for Hackathon Judges

This project is designed with security in mind:

- **Testnet Only**: All demonstrations use Sepolia testnet
- **Audited Libraries**: OpenZeppelin and established patterns
- **No Private Keys**: Frontend never handles private keys directly
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative security settings throughout
