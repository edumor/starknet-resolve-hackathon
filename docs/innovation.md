# Innovation Track Documentation

## Overview
The Innovation Track showcases novel DeFi primitives on Starknet, including a dynamic fee AMM, flash loan capabilities, and advanced liquidity management features that push the boundaries of decentralized finance.

## Smart Contract: InnovativeDEX

### Location
`contracts/innovation/innovative_dex.cairo`

### Key Innovations

#### 1. Dynamic Fee AMM
Traditional AMMs use fixed fees (e.g., 0.3%), but our dynamic fee model adjusts based on market conditions.

**How It Works:**
- Base fee starts at 0.3% (30 basis points)
- Fee increases during high volatility (up to 0.5%)
- Fee decreases during stable periods (down to 0.2%)
- Protects LPs from impermanent loss
- Optimizes for both traders and liquidity providers

**Benefits:**
- **For LPs:** Higher fees during risky periods compensate for IL
- **For Traders:** Lower fees during stable markets
- **For Protocol:** Adaptive to market conditions

#### 2. Flash Loans
Borrow any amount without collateral, repay in same transaction.

**Use Cases:**
- **Arbitrage:** Exploit price differences across DEXs
- **Liquidations:** Liquidate undercollateralized positions
- **Collateral Swaps:** Change collateral type without withdrawing
- **Leverage:** Amplify trading positions temporarily

**Safety:**
- Atomic execution (all or nothing)
- 0.3% flash loan fee
- Prevents unauthorized use
- Gas-efficient implementation

#### 3. Cross-Chain Liquidity
Aggregate liquidity from multiple blockchains for better pricing.

**Architecture:**
- Bridge integrations (LayerZero, Stargate)
- Cross-chain message passing
- Unified liquidity pools
- Multi-chain routing

**Benefits:**
- Deeper liquidity
- Better price execution
- Reduced slippage
- More trading pairs

### Contract Functions

#### `add_liquidity(token0: ContractAddress, token1: ContractAddress, amount0: u256, amount1: u256) -> u256`
Adds liquidity to a trading pair.

**Parameters:**
- `token0`: First token address
- `token1`: Second token address
- `amount0`: Amount of first token
- `amount1`: Amount of second token

**Returns:** LP tokens minted

**Process:**
1. Calculate proportional amounts
2. Mint LP tokens based on contribution
3. Update pool reserves
4. Emit LiquidityAdded event

#### `swap(token_in: ContractAddress, token_out: ContractAddress, amount_in: u256, min_amount_out: u256) -> u256`
Swaps tokens with dynamic fee calculation.

**Parameters:**
- `token_in`: Input token address
- `token_out`: Output token address
- `amount_in`: Input amount
- `min_amount_out`: Minimum output (slippage protection)

**Returns:** Actual output amount

**Fee Calculation:**
```
base_fee = 30 // 0.3%
if volume_24h > threshold:
    fee = base_fee * 1.5 // Increase during high volume
else:
    fee = base_fee
```

**Process:**
1. Calculate dynamic fee
2. Apply constant product formula: x * y = k
3. Check slippage tolerance
4. Execute swap
5. Update pool state
6. Emit Swap event

#### `flash_loan(token: ContractAddress, amount: u256, callback_contract: ContractAddress)`
Executes flash loan.

**Parameters:**
- `token`: Token to borrow
- `amount`: Borrow amount
- `callback_contract`: Contract to call with borrowed funds

**Process:**
1. Transfer tokens to borrower
2. Call borrower's callback function
3. Verify tokens + fee returned
4. Revert if not returned
5. Add fee to liquidity pool

#### `get_pool(token0: ContractAddress, token1: ContractAddress) -> Pool`
Retrieves pool information.

**Returns:**
- Reserve amounts
- Base fee
- 24h volume
- Last update timestamp

- **Advantage:** Better for volatile pairs
- **Different:** Fee model

### vs. Balancer
- **Different:** 2-token vs. multi-token pools
- **Advantage:** Simpler to understand
- **Similar:** Flexible fee structures

## Integration Examples

### Add Liquidity
```typescript
// Approve tokens
await token0.approve(dex.address, amount0);
await token1.approve(dex.address, amount1);

// Add liquidity
const lpTokens = await dex.add_liquidity(
  token0.address,
  token1.address,
  amount0,
  amount1
);
```

### Swap Tokens
```typescript
// Calculate minimum output with 1% slippage
const minOutput = expectedOutput * 0.99;

// Execute swap
const actualOutput = await dex.swap(
  tokenIn.address,
  tokenOut.address,
  amountIn,
  minOutput
);
```

### Flash Loan
```typescript
// Deploy flash loan receiver contract
const receiver = await deployFlashLoanReceiver();

// Execute flash loan
await dex.flash_loan(
  token.address,
  loanAmount,
  receiver.address
);

// Receiver must implement:
interface IFlashLoanReceiver {
  function onFlashLoan(
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 fee
  ) external;
}
```

## Economic Model

### Fee Distribution
- 0.25% to liquidity providers
- 0.05% to protocol treasury
- Dynamic adjustment based on volume

### LP Token Value
```
lp_token_value = (reserve0 + reserve1 + collected_fees) / total_lp_supply
```

### Impermanent Loss Protection
Dynamic fees help offset IL:
- Higher fees during volatile periods
- Compensates LPs for price divergence
- Reduces long-term IL impact

## Security Considerations

### Flash Loan Safety
- Reentrancy guards on all functions
- Balance checks before/after loan
- Fee verification
- Callback validation

### Slippage Protection
- Required minimum output parameter
- Deadline for transaction validity
- Front-running mitigation

### Pool Security
- Minimum liquidity locked permanently
- Overflow/underflow protection
- Safe math operations
- Access control where needed
