## üé¨ Scene 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Show GitHub README with project overview]**

"Hi! I'm presenting my comprehensive project for the Starknet Re{Solve} Hackathon. 

This is a multi-track implementation that covers ALL six categories of the hackathon: Next-Generation Payments, Mobile-First dApps, On-Chain Gaming, Privacy and Identity, Bitcoin Integration, and Open Innovation. 

The project is eligible for over forty-three thousand five hundred dollars in prizes across all tracks, making it one of the most comprehensive submissions in the hackathon."

## üé¨ Scene 2: Architecture (0:30 - 1:00)

**[Navigate through project structure - contracts, frontend, mobile folders]**

"Let me show you the technical architecture. 

We have Cairo smart contracts for each track: a payment system with ultra-low fees of just zero point one percent, Dojo gaming contracts for on-chain battles, a privacy identity system using zero-knowledge proofs, and a Bitcoin bridge for cross-chain integration.

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript for web access, plus a complete React Native mobile application for native iOS and Android experiences."

**[Visual: Open each .cairo file briefly, show package.json files]**

## üé¨ Scene 3: Live Demo (1:00 - 1:30)

**[Start npm start, navigate to localhost:3000]**

"Now let's see it in action. I'm starting the development server and you can see the application loading at localhost three thousand.

The app includes comprehensive wallet integration with debugging tools and supports multiple Starknet wallets like Argent X and Braavos. Here I'm connecting my wallet, and you can see the detailed connection information and debug status."

## üé¨ Scene 4: Track Features (1:30 - 2:30)

**[Navigate through each page - 15 seconds per track]**

"Each hackathon track has its dedicated interface. 

The Payments system processes transactions with ultra-low fees and instant settlement using Starknet's scaling technology.

The Gaming section features Dojo-powered player battles, NFT item crafting, and energy-based gameplay mechanics.

Privacy implements zero-knowledge proofs for anonymous age verification and identity management without revealing personal data.

The Bitcoin integration enables seamless cross-chain bridging between Bitcoin Layer 1 and Starknet assets.

And the mobile interface provides native app experiences for all these features with QR code scanning and offline capabilities."

## üé¨ Scene 5: Innovation (2:30 - 3:00)

**[Show code snippets, documentation, README highlights]**

"The technical innovation lies in the seamless integration of all six tracks using Cairo two point zero, OpenZeppelin security standards, and modern React architecture.

Everything is thoroughly documented, tested, and ready for production deployment. This project demonstrates the full potential of Starknet's ecosystem for building tomorrow's decentralized applications with ultra-low fees, Ethereum security, and Bitcoin integration.

Thank you for watching, and I'm excited to contribute to the future of blockchain technology with Starknet!"

- **"Production ready"** - Professional quality

## üéØ Backup Phrases (if needed)

If you need to adjust timing:
- **Shorter**: "This project covers all six hackathon tracks"
- **Longer**: "This comprehensive implementation demonstrates..."
- **Technical**: "Built with Cairo 2.0 and modern React architecture"
- **Impact**: "Showcasing the future of decentralized applications"

## üìä Timing Checkpoints

- **30 seconds**: Should be finishing introduction
- **60 seconds**: Should be starting live demo  
- **90 seconds**: Should be halfway through track features
- **2:30**: Should be starting conclusion
- **3:00**: Must be finished

Good luck with your recording! üöÄ
